# NEMSIO

The NCEPLIBS-nemsio library and utilities perform I/O for the NCEP
models using NOAA Environmental Modeling System (NEMS) format. The
NCEPLIBS-nemsio code is part of the
[NCEPLIBS](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS) project.

For complete documentation see
https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-nemsio/.

For more information about NEMS, see the [NEMS NMMB documentation
site](https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/txt_descriptions/NEMS_NMM_doc.shtml).

## Authors

M.Iredell, J.Wang, Hang Lei, mahajan, other NCEP/EMC developers.

Code manager: Hang Lei

## Prerequisites

This library requires the
[NCEPLIBS-bacio](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-bacio) and the
[NCEPLIBS-w3emc](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-w3emc)
libraries.

This library also requires an MPI-enabled Fortran compiler.

## Installing

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/bacio;/path/to/w3emc" ..
make -j2
make install
```

### Utilities
- `nemsio_get` - get the value of a variable in the file
- `nemsio_read` - read a nemsio file and print statistics to screen
- `nemsio_chgdate` - change datetime stamp in the nemsio file
- `mkgfsnemsioctl` - create GrADS ctl file to read nemsio data in GrADS

### Testing
`ctest` is used to read a test file.
